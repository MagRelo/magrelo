# Hello 👋

I'm Matt Lovan, a full-stack JavaScript developer. My typical stack includes React, Node, PostgreSQL, and Solidity. 

## Featured Project

### ["Matt Lovan is a Web Developer"](https://mattlovan.com)
This is my personal homepage & blog. It uses free, open-source components built into Docker containers and deployed on a Linux VM. See my blog post for a detailed look at the architecture.

**Highlights:**
- **Dockerized Architecture** – Each component runs in a seperate Docker container. Makes it easy to scale and/or add new apps.
- **Auto-renewing SSL certificates (https)** – Uses certbot to auto-renew LetsEncrypt SSL certificates every 60 days
- **Ghost CMS** – Ghost is an open-source headless Node.js content management system
- **Custom React Frontend** – client-side routing, SASS, 
- **Dynamic Social Metadata** – modify the page's metadata to support SEO & social cards
