# Hello 👋

I'm Matt Lovan, a Full Stack JavaScript developer focused on **cryptography, game theory, and mechanism design**.

I build blockchain systems and cryptographic primitives that solve real-world problems—improving coordination mechanisms, enabling new forms of digital ownership, and creating more transparent governance structures. My work sits at the intersection of game theory, cryptography, and practical engineering.

## Featured Projects

### 🌳 referralTree

**Multi-Level Referral Reward System** – A Solidity smart contract system implementing tree-based referral chains with game-theoretic incentives for viral growth.

Build exponential network growth through multi-level referral rewards. Users earn rewards not just from their own referrals, but also from their referrer's referrals, creating cascading incentive structures that align individual actions with network expansion.

**Highlights:**

- **Solidity Smart Contracts** – Gas-optimized tree data structures for efficient referral tracking
- **Foundry Testing** – Comprehensive test suite for contract logic and edge cases
- **Game Theory Design** – Incentive mechanisms that encourage genuine network growth
- **Ethereum Compatible** – Deployable on any EVM-compatible chain

### 💼 TalentRelay

**Earn revenue for your community by helping them find great jobs.**

A full-stack platform that enables communities to monetize job placement through referral rewards. Combines traditional web infrastructure with blockchain-inspired incentive structures.

**Highlights:**

- **React.js Frontend** – React Router, SASS, modern UI/UX
- **Node.js Server** – RESTful API with authentication and payment processing
- **MongoDB** – Flexible data models for users, jobs, and referral tracking
- **Google Authentication (OAuth)** – Seamless user onboarding
- **Stripe & Plaid integrations** – Accept payments and send money to users programmatically
- **Automated Emails** – Programmatic email using Sendgrid for notifications and updates

## Other Projects

### 🎨 RARA Protocol

A cross-chain EVM protocol designed to incentivize the curation of interesting and valuable NFTs. Each protocol interaction produces a unique NFT, creating a self-reinforcing curation economy.

**Highlights:**

- **Cross-Chain EVM Protocol** – Deployed across multiple chains
- **Mechanism Design** – Incentive structures for quality curation
- **NFT Generation** – Each interaction creates unique on-chain artifacts

### ⚖️ Priority Pricing

A protocol for demand-based pricing to reduce transaction costs for freelance workers. Explores mechanism design principles for dynamic pricing in decentralized labor markets.

**Highlights:**

- **Mechanism Design** – Game-theoretic pricing mechanisms
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts** – On-chain pricing logic
- **ERC721 Integration** – NFT-based worker representation

### 🎯 Curation Tournament

A game-theoretic mechanism modeled on poker tournaments, designed to encourage a group of players to reach consensus around a list of items. Players can increase their share of the pot by predicting the group consensus around adding or removing items from the list.

**Highlights:**

- **Mechanism Design** – Consensus-building through prediction markets
- **Game Theory** – Incentive alignment for group decision-making
